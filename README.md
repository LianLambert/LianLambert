### Hey, I'm Lian! ðŸ‘‹  

I recently graduated from McGill with a double major in Software Engineering and Psychology. I love combining tech with an understanding of how people think and interact with design. Iâ€™m passionate about web development, game development and anything that lets me use my creativity.
